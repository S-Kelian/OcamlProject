## Desciption
**4th year Ocaml project** : Implementation of the **Ford-Fulkerson algorithm** to get the maximum flow of a graph.

## Progress

- [x] Minimum project : Implement the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm
- [x] Medium project : The Cricket elimination project
    - [x] Creation of the graph
    - [x] Algorithm isEliminated ?

## Test Minimum project
To test the project run ```make demo``` in the root directory of the project. You can change the graph to test modifing the Makefile and choose the graph to test line 5 : ``` graph?= graphX.txt```.

## Test Medium project
To test the medium project, run ```make medium``` in the root directory of the project. You can change the team to test if she is eliminate modifing the Makefile and choose the team to test line 7 : ``` team?= name```.
For the moment we can test in only one specific configuration but you can create a new one taking the example of games/game1.txt
